# SocietySimulator

The intention is to recreate many social behaviour (starting from very basic like work and walk) and recreate interaction between
various societies sharing the same territory, everything automated by a very basic AI.

#### Installation

Installation is very simple, at the moment the program is working correctly on Linux and MacOSX. Windows doesn't support colors in
terminal, making the application very hard to understand. As soon as I'll release a graphical version, I will make sure is supported
by all main operating system!

Simply clone the repo
```bash
  git clone https://www.github.com/gabryatfendor/SocietySimulator
```
Change directory into it and make
```bash
  cd SocietySimulator/
  make
```
To run the program once installed
```bash
  ./SocietySimulator.out
```
To clean output files
```bash
  make clean
```
#### CONFIG:

Don't add any configuration except from the current one; you can
still modify the current variables. The format must remain
*variable* = *value*.
